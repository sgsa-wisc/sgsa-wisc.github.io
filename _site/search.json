It’s a great introduction to the apartment hunting process and the neighborhood vibes around Madison.\n\nAn Introduction to the Madison neighborhoods with some idea of what your surrounding amenities and daily commute will be like, along with some monthly rent estimates. One popular area left out of the guide is the Hilldale Shopping Area apartments; it is a very lively part of town with a nearby mall, Target, Whole Foods, and a convenient 20 minute bus commute to the Medical Sciences Building."

We aim to have a speaker about once every other week. Future iterations of the seminar will include topics such as internship experience and computing workshops, depending on interest. We hope to have food at each of the seminars depending on funding!\nThe series has a number of goals: 1. Provide opportunities for graduate students to practice presentations for upcoming conferences or group meetings and receive feedback from other graduate students in a more comfortable and informal environment 2. Serve to facilitate casual interactions with other students with similar research interests. 3. Keep students active and aware of peer research work. 4. Share notable internship and teaching experiences. 5. Make useful workshops for students.\n\nFall 2023\nThe list of seminars planned for this semester is given below.

    "text": "Graduate and Professional Student Assistance Specialist: The Graduate School and the Dean of Students Office jointly support a staff position focused on graduate student needs. Elaine Goetz-Berman serves in this role, which includes support, advocacy, and resource referral for graduate students. Elaine’s approach to working with graduate students centers on her specialized knowledge about the unique academic and personal challenges they face.\n\nUniversity Health Services\nUHS offers a safe and confidential environment with a variety of support services available free of charge and open to all graduate students. These include individual, couple/partner, and group counseling, as well as stress management and psychiatry services.\nUHS employs Access Consultation phone screening to replace the drop-in triage system. Students can call 608-265-5600 or log in to MyUHS for 24-hour appointment booking. There are also a limited number of drop-in appointments available every day at UHS if a student needs immediate access to UHS. If there is a risk of suicide or concern about well-being of a student, call UHS 24-hour crisis service to speak with an on-call counselor at 608-265-5600, option 9. If a situation is immediately life threatening, call 911.\nIn addition, UHS hosts a variety of group counseling opportunities:\n\nDissertators’ Group (Wednesdays 12:00-1:30pm) - A supportive group environment focused on the emotional, behavioral, and organizational challenges associated with the dissertation process.\nGraduate Students’ Group (Mondays 10:00am-11:30am; Thursdays 2:45-4:15pm) - This group examines the sources of stress, ways of coping, and the role of peer support in adjusting to a role that often feels like it’s 24/7 as a graduate student.\nGraduate Women’s Group (Fridays 3:00-4:30pm) - Through offering support to others and receiving support, group members are challenged to learn about themselves, initiate change, and exercise honesty in a safe space.\nGraduate Student Process and Support Group (Tuesdays 2:00-3:00pm) - Graduate students will receive support around common stressors related to academics (“imposter syndrome,” work/life balance, anxiety), connect around shared experiences, and give and receive feedback that can help build greater self-awareness.\nMulticultural Graduate Student Support Group - New as of summer 2019, this group meets to discuss weekly topics selected by group members. A licensed mental health therapist from UHS who is a person of color facilitates these bi-weekly meetings. This is a gently facilitated, non-therapeutic support group. Read more about the group here.\n\nThe groups listed above are just a few examples. Additional groups address students of color, LGBTQ support, relationships, depression, anxiety, and other topics. Groups typically meet one to two hours weekly, and may run from four to 12 weeks per semester. These groups fill up very quickly, so students should enroll in these groups at the beginning of the semester.\nAdditional UHS Resources Include:\n\nLet’s Talk – UHS offers drop-in consultations at locations around campus. It’s free, no appointment is necessary, and students are seen on a first-come, first-served basis.\nWellness Initiatives – UHS’s interdisciplinary program is designed to assist students’ pursuit of healthy mind, body, and spirit. Programs address healthy living, nutritional counseling, mindfulness, exercise consultation, yoga, massage, stress management, and more. Example sessions include (advance registration required): o Let’s Yoga: Mondays 4:00-4:50 (333 E. Campus Mall, 4213 Student Activity Center); Fridays 10:00-10:50am (Red Gym, Multicultural Student Center) o Meditation: Tuesdays 12:00-12:45pm (21 N. Park St, Room 7045); Wednesdays 12:00-12:45pm (Union South, see TITU) o Massage Therapy: By appointment, 50-minute massages for $40\nSupport for student military veterans – Student veterans transitioning to civilian life face unique challenges. UHS has counselors who are veterans themselves and counselors who are familiar with the needs of veterans.\nSexual Violence Prevention Program - UHS provides an online violence prevention program, which all incoming graduate students at UW-Madison are required to complete.\nSurvivor Services – Survivor Services provides confidential support for students who have experienced sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and/or stalking. Services include information and referral, individual and group counseling, and advocacy and accompaniments. Survivor Services holds drop-in Open Access hours during the semester located on the 8th floor of UHS (333 E. Campus Mall). Hours are M/T/W 1:00-4:00pm, and Th/F 9:00am-12:00pm. Survivor Services also offers support groups.\n\nAdditional support and resources on campus include:\n\n\nUWell\nThis is a comprehensive wellness initiative aiming to advance the health and wellbeing of the entire campus community by promoting existing resources.\n\n\nDean of Students Office\nThis office is committed to fostering a caring environment for all students. Responsibilities include the Student of Concern Report, the Bias Reporting Process, addressing Sexual Assault, Dating, and Domestic Violence, as well as many other issues affecting student wellbeing. Drop-in hours are Monday through Friday 8:30am-4:00pm, room 70 Bascom Hall.\n\n\nOmbuds Office\nUniversity employees, including graduate students, can seek guidance regarding workplace concerns without fear of reprisal and at no cost to them.\n\n\nEmployee Assistance Office\nGraduate students who hold assistantships are eligible to utilize the Employee Assistance Office. This is a confidential resource that provides counseling and consultation at no cost.\nIn addition to utilizing UHS’s services, you might also refer graduate students who hold assistantship appointments to seek mental health services covered by their health insurance plan."

Is there anything surprising about the data set? &gt; * Check if there’s anything you think might effect the measured outcome (time, position, interaction terms) and ask the client what they think the effect will be. &gt; &gt; Data &gt; * Does the data need to be transformed? &gt; * Is there any data missing? Do some categories have more data than others? &gt; * Is there anything striking about how the data is distributed? &gt; &gt; Graphs &gt; * Check if the data could be better represented by adding colors / shapes / widths / splitting graphs &gt; * Does our graph help in understanding the scientific question? If not, do we need it? &gt; * Could we add a line of fit / loess curve? &gt; &gt; Model &gt; * Have we included everything that makes sense in our model? &gt; * What assumptions are made for the model? Are they reasonable? &gt; * What are all the terms in the model? &gt; &gt; Analysis &gt; * Does the information we’ve taken from the model best answer the question? &gt; * Did we get any results that were surprising? Does this mean we need to redo anything?\nReport Writing Skills and Preparation while Taking Classes (Chelsea G.) &gt; * Start practicing LaTeX and ggplot (tidyverse) early when you are doing your assignments (i.e. homework for stat850). Practice typing them up and importing your figures. It’s easier to practice those skills over the first year and a half instead of in time pressured situations in which you need to generate a report such as during the Master’s Exam. &gt; &gt; * Make sure to practice precise interpretations and with all the calculations you’re doing, double check that you can interpret your results consistently and appropriately. Ask “how would I use that”? &gt; &gt; * While you are in class or have access to professors, always feel free to ask when the assumptions aren’t met, or you’re missing this data. Are these the questions that scientists typically have about this data? &gt; &gt; * When you’re asked on an assignment to analyze something in a certain way, ask yourself if there are other ways to answer this question. For example, we can talk about the mean response, or we can talk about the % mean response over a certain threshold.\nClient Meeting & Time Management (Michael L.) &gt; * Spend as much time as possible looking/working with the dataset before you meet with the clients. You will only have ~15 minutes to meet with the client, so the more time you spend with the datasets, the more directed your questions can be, and the more efficient use of your time. You don’t want to be left in the situation in which later you try an analysis but realize you come up with some counterintuitive result that can’t be clarified with the client. &gt; &gt; * Since you’re working with real client data here, expect to do at least a little data cleaning. In our case, there was ~4-5 hours of data cleaning before any sort of meaningful analysis! &gt; &gt; * Expect ~50 hours of work on the lower end, and 100+ hours on the upper end to do well! Cleaning, exploration, analysis, writing, graphics, formatting… it’s a lot of work!"
