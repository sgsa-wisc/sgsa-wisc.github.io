# Statistics Graduate Student Association

## University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison

We are the Statistics Graduate Student Association at UW-Madison. We were founded in 2018 with the goal of coordinating the graduate student activities of the department, which currently include:

- [Student seminars](seminar.md)
- Department Happy Hours (every other Friday) and Ice Cream Social
- Annual department picnic

We also hope to create a stronger community among the statistics department by focusing on development of our professional networks, training in modern statistical tools, and cultivation of research interests.

Here we have collected a number of resources we hope will be helpful for both current and new students here at UW--Madison, including information on [coursework](courses.md), [career resources](career.md), and [things to do around Madison](wisconsin.md).
